Project description:


          Our project consists of three different simple games sudoku, tic tac toe and the snake game. The application will ask the user which game of those three he/she wants to play; they choose one of them and then be directed to the chosen game. Sudoku is a mind game consisting of 9 squares and each one contains 9 also and the user should complete the puzzle without repeating the number in each small square, row, and collum. Snake game is a famous old game about a snake who tries to eat apples and every time he eats one, he becomes bigger and faster until he eats himself then he loses. Tic tac toe is game between two players, one with X and other with O, trying to make a diagonal, row, collum with his shape.


Problem description:
We wanted to make a game entertain us in our free time and help us return back to the old-fashioned games that we all used to love back in the day.


Work distribution:

Our project consists of 5 main files a file that takes the user’s name, a file that runs the main menu of the game and the 3 other files for each game: snake -tic tac toe – sudoku.
The first two files were a team work between the two of us , the snake game was Omar’s task to work on and the other two games were Filopater’s tasks but at the end we worked on all of them together.

How our program managed to solve the problem:
Our program works just fine and help us to spend our free time entertained which solved our problem.



User manual:
When opening the program, the user is required to login by entering his name then the main menu shows up and he is required to choose one of the three games whether it’s snake, tic tac toe or sudoku.
When choosing snake, the game starts immediately, and he tries to collect as many points as he can without hitting the walls or the snake body and when losing his high score is saved and shown for him and then returns to the main menu again.
When choosing tic tac toe the user plays against another user and after finishing the game, he presses space to get back to the main menu.
When choosing sudoku the game is presented for him to play and he can quit the game at any time and his progress will be saved for him to return and continue at any time.
